# DungeonFilter

Deprecated. With WoW 11.0 released, this is a built-in feature within the game. This code is no longer being maintained

----------------

Dungeon Filter is a World of Warcraft addon that allows filtering to specific dungeons. Although there is some filtering capabilities for the original dungeon finder within Warcraft, it is either limited either all dungeons or one specific dungeon. This allows the filtering to any number of dungeons, all or none.

If no dungeons are selected or if all dungeons are selected then the result is the same - all dungeons will be listed.
